make the movies have a report button in case it doesn't have good subtitles or is out of sync the movie has problems going to those who have that add-on if it's their problem or if it's yours try to reach out to you to solve the problem

I mean put a report function so that we can report the lack of subtitles or out of sync or the problem with a movie where that report should go to the one who owns the addon so that he knows it's a problem and to solve it, that's what I was referring to
